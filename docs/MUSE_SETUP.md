# Muse Setup Guide

Track your **Meta Muse coding-plan** quota (5-hour prompts + weekly usage) in onWatch.

Meta publishes no aggregate usage or billing endpoint for the coding plan, so onWatch reads the same subscription snapshot the `muse` CLI `/usage` command shows: each poll sends one minimal streamed probe (`POST https://api.meta.ai/v1/responses` with `stream: true`, input `"ping"`, `max_output_tokens: 16`) and extracts the inline `subscription` object.

The probe shares the Meta API key (and rate limit) with a live Muse TUI session. onWatch therefore:

- Stops reading the SSE stream as soon as the `subscription` event arrives, instead of holding the dummy generation open
- Skips the probe while a `muse` CLI process is running, so it cannot rate-limit your live session. The dashboard marks the Muse cards as paused for the duration (hover the grid for the reason) instead of ageing them into "stale", and resumes on the first poll after the CLI exits. No usage is recorded during that window
- Backs off a cycle on HTTP 429 rather than retrying into the TUI's quota window

---

## Prerequisites

- The [`muse` CLI](https://github.com/meta) installed and logged in (`muse login`), **or** a Meta API key
- onWatch installed ([Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start))

---

## How It Works

The probe response carries a Server-Sent Events stream. onWatch scans its `data:` lines and stops at the first event carrying a usable `subscription` snapshot, then closes the connection. Holding the stream open would keep a generation running on your plan and rate-limit a live `muse` session. Placeholder frames such as `{"subscription":{"window":{}}}` are skipped:

```json
{"subscription":{
  "tier":"pro",
  "weekly":{"resets_at":"1789344000","used_percent":"12.5"},
  "window":{"resets_at":"1789078632","used_percent":"34","window_duration_mins":"300"}}}
```

- `window` is the rolling prompt window (usually 300 minutes = 5 hours).
- `weekly` is the weekly quota.
- `used_percent` values arrive as strings and are clamped to 0-100.
- `resets_at` is an epoch timestamp in seconds.
- `tier` is an opaque account tier ID; onWatch stores it but only displays it when it is human-readable.

Both windows are tracked as percent quotas (`window_5h`, `weekly`) with reset-cycle detection, burn-rate insights, history, and notifications, like every other provider. Snapshots are stored locally in SQLite.

## 1. Log in to Muse

```bash
muse login
```

`META_API_KEY` always takes priority over the login session when both exist.

---

## 2. Configure onWatch

Use any one of the following.

### Option A - opt in and let onWatch find the key (recommended)

Muse tracking is off until you turn it on. Unlike every other provider, a Muse
poll is a real inference request that spends a prompt from your own 5h window,
so onWatch never starts polling just because it found credentials on disk.

Set this in `~/.onwatch/.env`:

```bash
MUSE_ENABLED=true
```

onWatch then resolves the key in this order:

1. `META_API_KEY` from the environment / `.env`
2. `providers.meta.api_key` in `~/.config/muse/auth.json` (must not be group/other-readable)
3. System credential store: macOS Keychain (`ai.meta.dev.credentials` / `meta`, written by `muse login`) or the Linux secret-service keyring

The probe model resolves as `META_MUSE_MODEL`, then the `model` in `~/.config/muse/settings.json`, then `muse-spark-1.3`.

Setting `META_API_KEY` explicitly, or enabling Muse in the dashboard settings,
also counts as opting in; `MUSE_ENABLED=true` is only needed when you want
onWatch to use the key `muse login` already stored.

To turn tracking off again, set:

```bash
MUSE_ENABLED=false
```

### Option B - `.env` with explicit key

Add to `~/.onwatch/.env` (best for Docker / headless hosts where no login session exists):

```bash
META_API_KEY=your_meta_api_key
# Optional: pin the probe model
# META_MUSE_MODEL=muse-spark-1.3
```

### Option C - setup wizard

```bash
onwatch setup
```

Choose "Muse (Meta) only" (or add it under "Multiple" / "All available"). When no login is detected the wizard accepts an optional key and verifies it with a single probe.

### Option D - dashboard settings

Open Settings, pick the Muse provider, and save an API key and/or probe model. Changes take effect after daemon restart.

---

## 3. Verify

```bash
# Poll once in the foreground and watch for the Muse agent
onwatch --debug 2>&1 | grep -i muse
```

Then open the dashboard and select the **Muse** tab. You should see the 5h Prompts and Weekly cards with reset countdowns.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `META_API_KEY` | Meta API key. Overrides the `muse login` session. |
| `META_MUSE_MODEL` | Probe model (default: your Muse settings model, else `muse-spark-1.3`). |
| `MUSE_ENABLED` | Set `true` to enable auto-detect, `false` to disable Muse tracking entirely. |
| `MUSE_AUTH_PATH` | Override the Muse login file path (default: `~/.config/muse/auth.json`). |
| `MUSE_BASE_URL` | Override the Meta Model API base URL for proxy setups (default: `https://api.meta.ai`). |

---

## Cost and polling notes

- Each poll costs exactly one minimal probe response (a `"ping"` input with at most 16 output tokens). At the default 120 s interval that is about 720 tiny probes per day.
- If you want fewer probes, raise `ONWATCH_POLL_INTERVAL` or pause the provider from the dashboard (telemetry toggle); polling and history resume when re-enabled.
- onWatch only sends `GET`-style usage reads plus the probe above. It never writes to your Muse files or keychain entries, and it never logs keys (values are redacted as `...` in logs and config dumps).

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Muse tab missing | Run `muse login`, or set `META_API_KEY` / `MUSE_ENABLED=true`, then restart the daemon. Check `onwatch --debug` for `Muse API client configured`. |
| Slow start / Muse missing after upgrading the binary | macOS shows a Keychain approval dialog for the new binary. Click **Always Allow**, or set `META_API_KEY` to skip the Keychain lookup (the daemon gives up after 15 s and starts without Muse rather than hanging). |
| `401 invalid_api_key` | The stored login key is stale. Re-run `muse login`, or export a fresh `META_API_KEY`. |
| `429 rate limited` | Back off and let the next poll retry; the daemon logs the event and keeps the last known values. |
| Model errors | Set `META_MUSE_MODEL` to a model your plan can access (for example `muse-spark-1.3`). |
| Windows hosts | No system-credential lookup is available; use `META_API_KEY` (Option B). |
